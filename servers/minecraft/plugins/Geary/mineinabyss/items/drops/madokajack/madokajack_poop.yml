    lore: |
      <yellow>Obtained from <#2252C2>Madokajacks <yellow>in
      <yellow>the <green>Great Fault<yellow>. They don't
      <yellow>appear to have much of a purpose.
      <#369AFF><i>Seems the Madokajack shat itself
      <#369AFF><i>before it died. Strangely its
      <#369AFF><i>droppings do not smell like feces?!
