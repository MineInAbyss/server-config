# IMPORTANT: before you put a shulker in a kit or a crate, make sure to hold it in your hand and run /axshulkers clear!
# if this is not done, people will be getting the exact same shulker, and they will share its inventory (probably not what you want)
# you don't need to worry about this, if you enable the 'auto-clear-shulkers' setting!

# EXPERIEMENTAL (this option was well tested, however it is still less safe than the default system)
# this setting will remove the safety UUID from the shulkers after they are closed
# it relies on java WeakReference-s to protect you from dupes
# this also force disables 'enable-obfuscation'

# how often should the plugin save shulker boxes from ram to the database?
# this is in minutes

# if this is on, the plugin won't save items to the shulker item
# this makes it impossible to see what is in the shulker without opening it
# note: this will break the shulker peeking functionality in plugins (like in auction houses or [item] plugins)
# incompatible with auto-clear-shulkers

# when in creative mode, the plugin will not modify any of the shulkers
# note that this probably allows some dupes in creative mode, of course in creative you can already duplicate items so it shouldn't be a big deal

# if enabled and somehow a shulker has a uuid, but it is not in the database, the contents of that shulker will be removed

# the only reason you should disable this is if you decided to delete the axshulkers database without resetting players' shulkers

# what should the nbt that the plugin places on shulkers be named?
# note that the plugin will not clean up old ones, so changing this is not recommended
# changing this while the server is running can lead to dupes
# if you have deleted the axshulkers database without deleting the items, it is recommended to change this to avoid item loss
