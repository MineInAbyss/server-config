# Model-Engine:
#   Settings for the plugin.
# 
#   Active-Range:
#     How close to the model in blocks should the player be to 
#     activate the model. Setting to 0 disable this function.
# 
#   Marker-Tick:
#     How long in ticks would the armor stand take before changing
#     back to marker when out of ground. If you experience weird
#     behaviours or constant darkening, set option to 0.
# 
#   Strict-Raytrace:
#     If set to false, default entities have a higher priority on
#     hit and click detection, even when the modeled entity is in
#     front of them.
# 
#   Use-Slerp:
#     If set to true, all rotations would take the shortest path.
#     Otherwise, normal linear interpolation would be used.
# 
#   Animation:
#     The animation name for the default states.
# 
#   Mode:
#     Change the algorithm used to handle certain functions. It is
#     recommended to keep both modes at Mode A.
#     Animation:
#       A: Smoother, but less accurate.
#       B: More accurate, but will cause slight delay to Movement A
#     Movement:
#       A: Smoother
#       B: More accurate, but movement of model runs at 20 fps
# 
# 
# Model-Generator:
#   Settings for the model generator.
# 
#   Generate-On-Start:
#     Disable this option if you don't want the generator to run
#     every time you restart.
#     If you want to update the files, do /meg reload models.
# 
#   Enable-Error:
#     If disabled, no error logs would be shown.
# 
#   Overwrite:
#     If set to false, you can only update models by deleting
#     files in the model folder under resource pack.
# 
#   Namespace:
#     Namespace used when generating the resource pack. Usually,
#     it will be the name of your server.
# 
#   Compartment-Size:
#     How many custom model data can one folder contains.
#     Includes Root folder.
